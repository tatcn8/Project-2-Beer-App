# Project-2-BEER APP
## Project 2 Proposal Ted Tash SEIR-1213
## Project Description:
 The website will have a home landing page with a “welcome” message. There will be a navbar with the top 100 beers index and domestic breweries. When the top 100 beers is clicked, the list of 100 beers is displayed along with some baseline info on each beer. A "more details" button is available and when clicked with render a details page with details on the specific beer selected. Back on the homepage, if domestic breweries is selected, the user will be brought to a list of all 50 states. When a state is selected, a list of 10 breweries from that state will appear along with some information about each of the breweries. There will also be a link which will re-direct the user to the selected breweries' website.

## MVP User Story:
*As a beer drinker, I would visit the homepage so I could gain more info about beer.

*As a beer drinker in America, I would click on "domestic breweries" to see breweries from each state.

*As a beer drinker that lives in Missouri, I would click on "Missouri" to see breweries from my state.

*As a curious beer drinker, I would visit a missouri brewery's website to learn even more about that brewery and its beer.

*At this point, I would be done with domestic beers, and would return home to check out the other features on the site.

*As a beer drinker interested in the best beers in the world, I would visit the "top 100" beers tab to see the highest ranked beers in the world.

*As a beer drinker interested in a single beer, I would click on a beer to get more details about it (such as where it is made, it's score, etc)

*At this point, I would be done with the site and get back to instagram to watch cat videos.
