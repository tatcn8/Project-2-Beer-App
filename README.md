# Project-2-Stock-Data
## Project 2 Proposal Ted Tash SEIR-1213
## Project Description:
 The website will have a home landing page with a “welcome” message. There will be a navbar that has two options: “Stocks” and “Crypto”. When either option is selected the user will be taken to a list of either Stock or Crypto data (the name of the symbol and the current price). When the user clicks on a single stock or crypto from the list, they will be taken to a page that displays greater detail about that individual stock (or crypto) such as open price, price history, 52 week high/low, etc.

## MVP User Story:
As a user, I want to check financial data so I can make lots of money. I would visit the site to be greeted by the homepage; and there I could begin to check financial data. As a stock investor, I would click the stocks option so I can check stock data. As an investor in a single stock, I would click on a single stock to see an in-depth analysis of of individual stocks. As a trendy guy that likes to lose money, I want to invest in cryptocurrency; so I would click on the crypto option to see a full list of currencies. From there, I would click on an individual currency for more in-depth information. At this point, I would be done and get back to instagram to watch cat videos.
